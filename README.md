# DesignPattern

## 1. What is this eclipse project for ?

The 'Design Pattern' project is a sample of how to use design patterns in Java.

The packages in this project are named by design patterns. Each design pattern has used in my daily work, and they are useful.

This project is designed to implement commonly used design patterns in daily work as many as possible, and of course , if I find some interesting methods of programming , they will be included too.
